Setting Up:
1. Install Pycharm Community Edition(ran on version 2018.2.3)
2. Install Python version 3.7
3. Install matplotlib by clicking File on the top right and then go to
Settings/Project: CS415_Project1/Project Interpreter. Then click on the plus/install icon on the right side of the
menu, search and select matplotlib, and install package.
4. Run the program from Project1.py

Using the Program:
1. You will be prompted with a task(1, 2, 3) and mode(1 for User Testing and 2 for Scatter Plot) to run. The program
will exit if none of these inputs are selected for each prompt.

Extra Credit:
-We got feedback from Tairyn and Austin.
-When going over the report the presentation of the graphs and the explanations were presented clearly and well
formatted. However, the graphs were plotted as points instead of having lines. To make the graphs clearer they should
be plotted as lines. The graphs could also use more input values to more clearly show the complexity of each graph.
Overall the report looked good, but needed some minor adjustments.
